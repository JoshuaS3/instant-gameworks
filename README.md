Instant Gameworks is meant to be a free-flow, flexible game engine that allows developers to create games with ease. Instant Gameworks runs on Microsoft's .NET framework, so only C#.NET and VB.NET are supported at the moment. Someone may create an unofficial wrapper in the future for another language, although this may prove difficult as OpenTK, the main dependency of the framework, is itself a C# wrapper of OpenGL.

Instant Gameworks only imports objects of filetype IGWO ([Instant Gameworks Object](https://www.github.com/joshuas3/instant-gameworks-object)). The filetype is stemmed from the Wavefront OBJ filetype, but in a binary/compact version.
